				"name": "Great Wall of China at Badaling",
				"ele": "614.0",
				"desc": "The Great Wall of China at Badaling is the most popular section, both for international and domestic tour groups. It's been restored quite recently and boasts a slide ride down, as well as a cable car. To get the most authentic (and least crowded) experience, climb up the Wall first and take the cable car down from the Eighth Tower in the north. This will ensure you've had a good hike, seen some stunning views and haven't had to dodge too many Chinese tourists taking photos. Chinese tourists do like posing for photographs with Westerners, so be prepared to smile and say \"Cheese!\"\n\nThe 919 bus drops you off at the slide car ticket office section of the car park (the slide car is a sort of cross between a toboggan and a slide and is extremely tacky). To avoid the crowds and get your climb out of the way early on, head back up hill to the garish Bear Park entrance that you drove past. Don't be under any illusions: The Great Wall of China is NOT flat! However you choose to get to the Great Wall, you'll be climbing and descending steep slopes and steps. By climbing first, you get to experience the grandeur of the Wall in relative peace, beat the lines for the ride downhill and be at the right exit for the bus back to Beijing.\n\nBear Park (which this tour of the Wall takes you through from necessity) lines the path up to the 10th Tower in the north. It's free to walk through and is designed as a sideshow for Chinese tourists, composed of an enclosure for some black bears, souvenir stands and opportunities to pose for photos with animals. It's about a five-minute walk to get through everything and although Western animal lovers will probably not want to linger, it's an interesting insight into Chinese tourism. If you're buying water or snacks here, don't pay more the 3RMB for a 500-milliliter bottle of water, and bear in mind that it will be more expensive on the Wall. Continue to head uphill until you reach the gate to get onto the Great Wall, where you pay for your entrance ticket. If you get the cable car down again, you pay for this at the cable car station once you're on the Wall."

Follow the steps up around to the right, through a narrow archway and you'll be standing on one of the wonders of the world. It's said that you're not a \"hero\" unless you've climbed the Great Wall, so here's your chance to prove yourself!\n\nHead left for the hike round to the Eighth Tower in the north (and the cable car down) or run up the slope to the right for a quick photo opportunity-and to get a panorama of where you're heading."

				"desc": "You can't go wrong on the Wall, you just keep following it round. Be careful as some sections are extremely steep and the steps-on the sections where there are steps-can be high and uneven. If you look to the right as you climb and descend, you'll see mountain vistas; to the left, you'll see how the Great Wall curves over and around the mountain sides.\n\nDepending on your fitness level and how often you stop to rest and take in the views, the hike to the Eighth Tower should take less than an hour."

The route is clearly marked.\n\nThe cable car costs 60RMB for an adult single journey, 30RMB for children and free for children shorter than 1.2 meters (3 feet 11 inches). Up to six people can fit in a car at once and the journey down takes around 10 minutes."

				"desc": "When you get out of the cable car, follow the signs downhill to the 919 bus stop. On the way you'll pass several restaurants where you can grab some food-the quality is reasonable but expect prices fit for a tourist destination (around 30-50RMB per dish). You'll also pass the Great Wall Museum on the left side of the broad road that runs downhill; your Great Wall ticket should get you entrance to this. The museum was built in 1994 and has several exhibition rooms where you can learn about the history and significance of the Great Wall.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill, pass through the archway across the road and cross over to the other side-the 919 will pick you up from here. Buses depart frequently (every 10-15 minutes in summer, as on the way to Badaling). The last one leaves around 7pm. It's another 12RMB per person and an hour's journey back to Jian Lou. Taxi drivers also wait around here; if you decide to get a taxi, make sure to haggle for your price-200RMB one way is more than reasonable."
