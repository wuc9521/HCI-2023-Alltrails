Half way is the tea house.\n\nIt was originally built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the gardens. What is seen today is largely the result of restoration in 1855 when it was turned into a teahouse. \n\nIf you choose to have tea here you'll be in good company, it's been visited by Queen Elizabeth II and Bill Clinton. To get the best view sit upstairs. There are sometimes performances of Chinese classical music. \n\nConsider coming in the evening when the crowds melt away and the whole area takes on an altogether more peaceful feel. \n\nHours: Daily 8.30am - 9.30pm\n\nCost: Y68\/person for tea.

				"ele": "10.0",
				"desc": "Pick a quiet day and be transported from the bustle of the bazaar and to about as much tranquility as you can find in modern Shanghai! These gardens were constructed over the course of 18 years (1559-1577) by Pan Yunduan. As the administrative commissioner in the Ming government for Sichuan Province he built these private gardens for his parents.  \n\nThe gardens were severely damaged in the Opium War (1842) and British officers were barracked here. Then during the Taiping Rebellion they took a battering from French troops. Largely what is seen today is thanks to much needed restoration that began in 1956 and culminated with their opening to the public in 1961.\n\nThe gardens cover an area of around 5 acres (2 hectares) and incorporate the rock and water features of classical Chinese gardens. Exquisite Jade Rock is the piece de resistance and is nearly 11 feet high (3.3 meters) and contains 72 holes. It is said that when an incense stick burns underneath smoke will waft from all the holes. Pan Yunduan is said to have been so fond of this rock that he built Yuhau Hall facing it so as to allow guests to sit and admire it. \n\nLook out for features such as dragons snaking their way along the tops of walls and the beautiful woodwork in pavilions. \n\nAvoid weekends if possible as the gardens get very crowded. Winter is a good time to visit. \n---\nHours: 8.30am - 5.30 pm (last tickets 5.00). \n\nCost: \nAdults: Y40 \nChildren and students: Y20 but requires student card (unlikely to be honored if in English)\nChildren under 6 years old or 1.3 meters in height free if accompanied by adult. \nSeniors over 60: Y20 with ID. \n\nAddress: Yuyuan Garden. Old town. Shanghai"

These types of temples were common in ancient China.
