				"desc": "The term shikumen literally means \"stone warehouse gate\" but is applied to a style of house special to Shanghai. Shikumen were arranged in alleyways (longtang) which were usually entered through a stone gate, hence the name. \n\nThey are unique for combining Chinese and western style in their two or three story designs. In many ways they are a Chinese version of the British terraced house! First appearing in the 19th century they reached their zenith in the pre-war era. They once made up the majority of housing in Shanghai. \n\nEach house was originally designed for one family, although it was common in the early days for the mezzanine room to be let out - particularly to Bohemian sorts. After Mao and the Communists took power, little new housing was built and an increasing urban population led to division into ever smaller units, meaning that such a house could be shared by as many as 10 families. \n\nThe museum illustrates life in a 10 room shikumen as they were originally intended for use. It is furnished with antiques to show Shanghainese family life.\n---\nHours: daily 10.30am - 10.30pm\n\nCost: \nAdults Y20\nChildren 3-12 years Y10\nSeniors 60 or over Y10\nAdults with student ID Y16\n\nAddress: No 25 Lane 181 Taicang Road.

Throw out the families that were living here and replace their homes with an \u00C3\u00BCber expensive hotel and high-end restaurants. \n\nPartly opened in 2010 as part of the Expo, city renovations to the area has still to take off. Probably due to poor public transport links and lack of parking, the restaurants are on the empty side. In the daytime a lot don't even bother to open. The area to the west side of Fuxing Road is still under construction and is meant to be more aimed at corporations. \n\nOn the plus side, the buildings all look very nice with their pebble dashed exteriors. Fuxing Park across the road was laid out by the French and might be worth a quick detour.\n\nAnd if you wondered about the hotel, instead of rooms, it has villas which apparently go for a cool Y40,000 per night. The Hotel Massenet takes its name from the original French name for the street. Beware: the hotel is very camera shy, banning pictures."

Still, it is a pedestrianised area of small shops selling souvenirs, curios, works of art and cafes and restaurants which spill out into the narrow lanes. It is a favourite with photographers. \n\nShops and boutiques worth looking out for include Feel Shanghai selling off the peg and tailor made clothing evoking the 1930s, and Deke Erh's photography gallery. \n\nAs a place to eat few of the restaurants are much good with most of them over priced for what you get."
