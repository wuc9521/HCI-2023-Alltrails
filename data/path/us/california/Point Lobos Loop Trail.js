Spotted Towhees, California Quail, and a number of warblers and thrushes can be heard if not seen.\n\nIn the spring, the swallows return to Point Lobos, and you can see Violet-Green Swallows nesting in woodpecker holes in the Pines along the Carmelo Meadows trail and Whaler's Knoll trail.\n\nA couple of years ago, the Reserve was abuzz when a birder found a Northern Saw-whet Owl nest in a dead pine tree just off the Carmelo Meadows trail.\n\nOne highlight of the pine forest is the annual termite hatch, which happens on the day after the first rain in the fall. It is a great time to see warblers and wrens, who are usually hidden, out in the open being gluttons. The best spot in the reserve to witness this is on the Pine Ridge Trail about 500 ft SW of the Piney Woods trail-head (go up the trail and turn right on the Pine Ridge trail, walk to the bench and then go about 100 ft further). It is a once a year thing."
