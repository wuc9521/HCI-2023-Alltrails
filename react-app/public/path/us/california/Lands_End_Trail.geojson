San Francisco mining engineer and entrepreneur Adolph Sutro owned much of the Lands End area.\u00A0He had bought the Cliff House in 1881 and would soon build his famous Sutro Baths and Sutro Heights gardens.\n\nSutro persuaded his financier cousin to construct a steam railway along the cliffs above the Golden Gate to bring city residents across the dunes and bluffs to his beach attractions. The steam-powered ferries and the Cliff House Railway operated from 1888 until 1905, when electric streetcars replaced the locomotives. Landslides closed the track in 1925. You can now hike the former railroad bed along the Coastal Trail to the Cliff House."
